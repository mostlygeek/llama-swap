# Routing capacity and request queues

There is no `models.*.maxConcurrentRequests` setting. The real per-model key
is `models.*.concurrencyLimit`, which limits active parallel requests.

The router serializes model swaps and queues requests until the selected model
is ready. Avoid using many simultaneous client retries as a capacity control:
they create more queued work. Choose a routing policy that fits the models that
may coexist, then set client timeouts high enough for the queue and load time.

Inspect the Activity view and logs when latency grows. A queue that never drains
usually means the command, proxy, or health check is wrong; see
`guides/model-runtime/troubleshooting-model-wont-load`.

## Global concurrency limit

`globalConcurrencyLimit` is a top-level setting, separate from
`models.*.concurrencyLimit`. It caps the number of inference requests served
at once across every model combined, using a single shared semaphore:

```yaml
globalConcurrencyLimit: 8
```

The default is `0`, meaning no limit — the semaphore is not even added to the
request chain, so a default config pays no cost for the feature. Once the
limit is reached, further requests are rejected immediately with an HTTP 429
response rather than queued; there is no wait for a slot to free up. Clients
should treat a 429 as a signal to back off and retry, the same way they handle
a per-model concurrency limit rejection.

Use this to protect shared hardware (CPU, disk, network) from being
overwhelmed by traffic spread across many different models, which a per-model
`concurrencyLimit` cannot do since it only counts requests to one model at a
time.
