# Running several models at once: groups and matrix

Out of the box llama-swap runs one model at a time. The `routing` section
changes that. There are two engines and you pick one:

```yaml
routing:
  router:
    use: group     # or: matrix
```

## `group` — the default, simpler

You define named groups of models and set two flags per group.

```yaml
routing:
  router:
    use: group
    settings:
      groups:
        # default behaviour: one model at a time, instance-wide
        main:
          swap: true         # only one member runs at a time
          exclusive: true    # running a member unloads every other group
          members: [llama, qwen]

        # these three run together, but any other group evicts them
        small:
          swap: false        # all members can be loaded at once
          exclusive: false   # loading one doesn't unload other groups
          members: [embeddings, reranker, whisper]

        # never unloaded by anything else
        forever:
          persistent: true
          swap: false
          exclusive: false
          members: [always-on-embeddings]
```

The three flags:

- **`swap`** (default `true`) — how members behave among *themselves*. `true`
  means one at a time; `false` means they all coexist.
- **`exclusive`** (default `true`) — how the group affects *other* groups.
  `true` means loading a member unloads everything else.
- **`persistent`** (default `false`) — other groups can never unload this one.

**A model can belong to only one group**, and every member must be a real model
ID.

The classic setup is one exclusive group for the big LLMs and one non-exclusive
group for small always-useful models like embeddings and rerankers.

## `matrix` — more work, far more flexible

The matrix router takes a list of model combinations that are allowed to run
concurrently and solves for the cheapest way to satisfy each request.

```yaml
routing:
  router:
    use: matrix
    settings:
      matrix:
        vars:
          g: gemma-model
          q: qwen-model
          v: voxtral-model

        evict_costs:
          v: 50              # vLLM, slow cold start — avoid evicting
          llama-70B: 30

        sets:
          standard:    "(g | q) & v"
          creative:    "(g | q) & stable-diffusion"
          full:        "llama-70B"
```

`sets` values are expressions:

| operator | meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `&` | AND — these run together |
| `\|` | OR — alternatives |
| `()` | grouping |
| `+name` | inline another set's expression |

`"(g \| q) & v"` expands to `[gemma, voxtral]` and `[qwen, voxtral]`.
Parenthesize mixed expressions so their intended capacity rule is obvious, and
test every requested combination: an expression that excludes a needed set can
make the router evict a model unexpectedly.

How the solver works when a request for model X arrives:

1. If X is already running, forward the request.
2. Otherwise collect every set containing X.
3. For each set, sum the `evict_costs` of running models *not* in that set.
4. Pick the lowest-cost set, ties broken by definition order.
5. Evict the models outside it, start X, forward the request.

Two things worth internalising:

- **Subsets are permitted.** A set `[a, b, c]` also allows `[a, b]`, `[a]` and
  so on. Only the requested model is started; the rest are not preloaded.
- **A model in no set can only run alone.**

`evict_costs` (default 1) is how you express "this one is painful to reload".
Give slow cold-starting backends a high cost.

### Catch unlisted models with `+undefined`

Use the reserved reference `+undefined` for models not referenced by a leaf in
any user-authored set. Vars resolve to their real model IDs before this check;
references such as `+base` are not leaves and do not define more models.

The orphan list is computed once at compile time and sorted by model ID, making
the synthesized expression deterministic. For example, if `a` is named by a
leaf while `b` and `c` are not, `+undefined` behaves as `(b | c)`:

```yaml
sets:
  always:  "task-small & embed-model"
  main:    "+always & moe-medium & (dense-a | dense-b)"
  scratch: "+always & +undefined"
```

If there are no orphans, the `+undefined` term is dropped. Empty results also
propagate through references, so `outer: "+empty & x"` behaves as `x` when
`empty` ultimately resolves only to an empty `+undefined`. A set containing
only an empty `+undefined` is never selectable.

A user-defined set named `undefined` takes precedence and disables synthesis.
When `+undefined` is referenced, startup and reload log one of:

- `matrix: synthesized set "undefined" = (modelA | modelB | ...)`
- `matrix: synthesized set "undefined" is empty; +undefined terms dropped`
- `matrix: set "undefined" is user-defined; orphan synthesis disabled`

Editing `models:` changes the orphan list on the next configuration reload by
design.

## Which one?

Use **group** if your setup is describable as "these run together, those swap
out". It is easier to read and easier to get right.

Use **matrix** when the combinations depend on which models are involved — a
70B that needs every GPU alone, versus several small models that fit together,
versus a mid-size LLM plus TTS. Groups cannot express that; matrix can.

## Request ordering

Queued requests are FIFO. You can give some models priority:

```yaml
routing:
  scheduler:
    use: fifo
    settings:
      fifo:
        priority:
          interactive-model: 10
          batch-model: 1
```

Higher numbers are serviced first. Models default to 0.
