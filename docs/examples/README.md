# Example Configs and Use Cases

A collections of usecases and examples for getting the most out of llama-swap.

* [Speculative Decoding](speculative-decoding/README.md) - using a small draft model can increase inference speeds from 20% to 40%. This example includes a configurations Qwen2.5-Coder-32B (2.5x increase) and Llama-3.1-70B (1.4x increase) in the best cases.
* [Optimizing Code Generation](benchmark-snakegame/README.md) - find the optimal settings for your machine. This example demonstrates defining multiple configurations and testing which one is fastest.
