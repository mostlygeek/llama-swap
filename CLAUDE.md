# Project: llama-swap

## Project Description:

llama-swap is a light weight, transparent proxy server that provides automatic model swapping to llama.cpp's server.

## Tech stack

- golang
- typescript, vite and react for UI (ui/)

## Testing

- `make test-dev` - Use this when making iterative changes. Runs `go test` and `staticcheck`. Fix any static checking errors.
- `make test-all` - runs at the end before completing work. Includes long running concurrency tests.

## Workflow Tasks

### Plan Improvements

Work plans are located in ai-plans/. Plans written by the user may be incomplete, contain inconsistencies or errors.

When the user asks to improve a plan follow these guidelines for expanding and improving it.

- Identify any inconsistencies.
- Expand plans out to be detailed specification of requirements and changes to be made.
- Plans should have at least these sections:
  - Title - very short, describes changes
  - Overview: A more detailed summary of goal and outcomes desired
  - Design Requirements: Detailed descriptions of what needs to be done
  - Testing Plan: Tests to be implemented
  - Checklist: A detailed list of changes to be made

Look for "plan expansion" as explicit instructions to improve a plan.

### Implementation of plans

When the user says "paint it", respond with "commencing automated assembly". Then implement the changes as described by the plan. Update the checklist as you complete items.

## General Rules

- when summarizing changes only include details that require further action (action items)
- when there are no action items, just say "Done."
