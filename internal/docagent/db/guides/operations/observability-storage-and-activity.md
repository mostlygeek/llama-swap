# Observability, storage and Activity

Use the Activity view for recent request timing and model events, logs for
process and proxy failures, and metrics for trends. `metricsMaxInMemory` and
`captureBuffer` bound retained in-memory data; increase them only when the
memory cost is acceptable.

```yaml
logLevel: debug
logToStdout: true
metricsMaxInMemory: 1000
captureBuffer: 100
```

Do not put secrets in captures or debug logs. Reduce retention after diagnosing
an issue.
